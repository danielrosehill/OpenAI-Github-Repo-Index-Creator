Generate a markdown index for the following GitHub repositories:

{repo_list}

Please group the repositories into categories.

If repositories have a similar theme, they should be grouped together under a heading. The headings should be H2s.

Organise the categories alphabetically.

Convert the repository names to make them more readable. For example, 'Prompts-And-Outputs' should be converted to 'Prompts And Outputs'.

Each repository should be a link to its GitHub URL.
